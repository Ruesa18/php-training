## How to get started
You can install all the dependencies via composer. Use the command `composer install` inside the projects root folder (`/php-training/`).
Composer will then read the `composer.json` file and install all needed libraries.
After that you're ready for training. You can find all exercises under `/php-training/exercises`.
